# Provision-then-exec wrapper for the Complement testee.
#
# Complement generates a fresh CA per run and copies it into every homeserver
# container at /complement/ca/{ca.crt,ca.key}. Each homeserver is expected to
# present a federation certificate signed by that CA so peers which validate
# certificates (e.g. Synapse) accept the connection. We sign one here for
# $SERVER_NAME and overwrite the baked self-signed certificate the image ships,
# then exec the server passed as our arguments.
#
# When the CA is absent (running outside Complement) the baked certificate is
# left in place, so this wrapper is a no-op in that case.
