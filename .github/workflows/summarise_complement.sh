# Complement adapter for the shared board engine. Sourced by the per-flavour
# drivers; not invoked directly. Drivers set:
#
#   track_name      Heading text (e.g. "Complement", "Complement-Crypto").
#   results         Path to the per-flavour results.jsonl.
#   metrics_tar     Optional. Path to per-run runtime_metrics.tar.zst. When
#                   set, emit_runtime_metrics() renders the metrics table.
#
# Runtime-metrics history is read from and written to small JSON digests the
# workflow restores from / saves to the GitHub Actions cache, passed via env:
#   RUNTIME_DIGEST_OWN   this branch's rolling ring (read for history columns,
#                        rewritten for the green-gated save step).
#   RUNTIME_DIGEST_MAIN  the default branch's anchor (read only; unset on it).
#   RUNTIME_DIGEST_KEEP  ring depth (3 off the default branch, 1 on it).
#
# Drivers then call `summarise_main "$@"`.
