"""Per-job wall-clock timing for the current run, rendered into the run summary.

Self-hosted runners are absent from the deprecated /timing billable endpoint, so
durations come from the jobs API's started_at/completed_at wall-clock stamps,
which cover every runner type. Nested reusable-workflow jobs (lint/test/package/
publish, all matrix expansions) share this run_id, so one top-level invocation
captures the whole pipeline.

Prior-run columns and the per-branch digest reuse the shared history engine:
when TIMINGS_HISTORY_OUT is set, the digest is read from the Actions cache
(TIMINGS_HISTORY_IN), this run is prepended, the buffer is truncated to
TIMINGS_KEEP, and up to two prior runs render as raw value columns labelled by
short sha."""
