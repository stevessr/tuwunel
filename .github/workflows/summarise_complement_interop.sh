# Known peer-side false positives, scored orange (accounted-for) not red
# (regression). These media tests exercise the legacy unauthenticated
# /_matrix/media/v3 path over federation; the Synapse peer removed it per MSC3916
# and 404s its own endpoint, while tuwunel serves the authenticated v1 path
# correctly. The failure is the peer's deprecation, not a tuwunel regression.
