//! Write-ahead-log coalescing via a scoped cork guard.
//!
//! Each `Map` insert or remove flushes RocksDB's write-ahead log to the OS
//! immediately after the mutation. "Corking" suppresses that per-write flush:
//! while one or more `Cork` guards are live, WAL records accumulate in the
//! in-memory buffer and reach the OS in a single coalesced batch, trading a
//! syscall per write for one flush per burst.
//!
//! Corking is purely a backend write-buffering optimization. It does not change
//! application logic and has no observable effect on the database API. A write
//! enters the memtable synchronously within the insert or remove call itself,
//! so reads return the new value whether or not a cork is held; the cork
//! governs only when WAL bytes reach the OS (the crash-durability window and
//! the flush syscall count), never what any reader or caller observes.
//!
//! Corks are reference-counted on the `Engine`. `Cork::new` raises the count
//! and `Drop` lowers it, so a guard's scope delimits the coalescing window;
//! nested guards compose, and per-write flushing resumes only when the last one
//! drops.
